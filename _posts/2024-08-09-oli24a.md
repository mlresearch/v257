abstract: Assessing students’ answers and in particular natural language answers is
  a crucial challenge in the field of education. Advances in transformer-based models
  such as Large Language Models(LLMs), have led to significant progress in various
  natural language tasks. Nevertheless, amidst the growing trend of evaluating LLMs
  across diverse tasks, evaluating LLMs in the realm of automated answer assessment
  has not received much attention. To address this gap, we explore the potential of
  using LLMs for automated assessment of student’s short and open-ended answers in
  program comprehension tasks. Particularly, we use LLMs to compare students’ explanations
  with expert explanations in the context of line-by-line explanations of computer
  programs. For comparison purposes, we assess both decoder-only Large Language Models
  (LLMs) and encoder-based Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) models in the context
  of assessing the correctness of students’ explanation of computer code. Our findings
  indicate that decoder-only LLMs, when prompted in few-shot and chain-of-thought
  setting perform comparable to fine-tuned encoder-based models in evaluating students’
  short answers in the programming domain.
