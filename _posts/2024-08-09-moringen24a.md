abstract: 'A typical process of learning to play a piece on a piano consists of a
  progression through a series of practice units that focus on individual dimensions
  of the skill, the so-called practice modes. Practice modes in learning to play music
  comprise a particularly large set of possibilities, such as hand coordination, posture,
  articulation, ability to read a music score, correct timing or pitch, etc. Self-guided
  practice is known to be suboptimal, and a model that schedules optimal practice
  to maximize a learnerâ€™s progress still does not exist. Because we each learn differently
  and there are many choices for possible piano practice tasks and methods, the set
  of practice modes should be dynamically adapted to the human learner, a process
  typically guided by a teacher. However, having a human teacher guide individual
  practice is not always feasible since it is time-consuming, expensive, and often
  unavailable. In this work, we present a modeling framework to guide the human learner
  through the learning process by choosing the practice modes generated by a policy
  model. To this end, we present a computational architecture building on a Gaussian
  process that incorporates 1) the learner state, 2) a policy that selects a suitable
  practice mode, 3) performance evaluation, and 4) expert knowledge. The proposed
  policy model is trained to approximate the expert-learner interaction during a practice
  session. In our future work, we will test different Bayesian optimization techniques,
  e.g., different acquisition functions, and evaluate their effect on the learning
  progress. '
