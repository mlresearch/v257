title: Evaluation of the Instance Weighting Strategy for Transfer Learning of Educational
  Predictive Models
booktitle: Proceedings of the 2024 AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence
year: '2023'
abstract: This work contributes to our understanding of how transfer learning can
  be used to improve educational predictive models across higher institution units.
  Specifically, we provide an empirical evaluation of the instance weighting strategy
  for transfer learning, whereby a model created from a source institution is modified
  based on the distribution characteristics of the target institution. In this work
  we demonstrated that this increases overall model goodness-of-fit, increases the
  goodness-of-fit for each demographic group considered, and reduces disparity between
  demographic groups when we consider a simulated institutional intervention that
  can only be deployed to 10% of the student body.
