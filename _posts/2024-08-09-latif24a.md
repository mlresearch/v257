abstract: This study explores the efficacy of a multi-perspective hybrid neural network
  (HNN) for scoring student responses in science education with an analytic rubric.
  We compared the accuracy of the HNN model with four ML approaches (BERT, ANN, Naive
  Bayes, and Logistic Regression). The results have shown that HHN achieved 8%, 3%,
  1%, and 0.12% higher accuracy than Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, ANN, and BERT,
  respectively, for five scoring aspects (p < 0.001). The overall HNN’s perceived
  accuracy (M = 96.23%, SD = 1.45%) is comparable to the (training and inference)
  expensive BERT model’s accuracy (M = 96.12%, SD = 1.52%). We also have observed
  that HNN is x2 more efficient in terms of training and inferencing than BERT and
  has comparable efficiency to the lightweight but less accurate Naive Bayes model.
  Our study confirmed the accuracy and efficiency of using HNN to automatically score
  students’ science writing.
