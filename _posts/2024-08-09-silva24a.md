abstract: Machine learning and deep learning models are pivotal in educational contexts,
  particularly in predicting student success. Despite their widespread application,
  a significant gap persists in comprehending the factors influencing these models’
  predictions, especially in explainability within education. This work addresses
  this gap by employing nine distinct explanation methods and conducting a comprehensive
  analysis to explore the correlation between the agreement among these methods in
  generating explanations and the predictive model’s performance. Applying Spearman’s
  correlation, our findings reveal a very strong correlation between the model’s performance
  and the level of agreement observed among the explanation methods.
