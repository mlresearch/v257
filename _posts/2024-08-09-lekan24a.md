abstract: Choosing an undergraduate major is an important decision that impacts academic
  and career outcomes. We investigate using GPT-4, a state-of-the-art large language
  model (LLM), to augment human advising for major selection. Through a 3-phase survey,
  we compare GPT suggestions and responses for undeclared Freshmen and Sophomore students
  (n=33) to expert responses from university advisors (n=25). Undeclared students
  were first surveyed on their interests and goals. These responses were then given
  to both campus advisors and to GPT to produce a major recommendation for each student.
  In the case of GPT, information about the majors offered on campus was added to
  the prompt. Advisors, overall, rated the recommendations of GPT to be highly helpful
  and agreed with their recommendations 33% of the time. Additionally, we observe
  more agreement with AI major recommendations when advisors see the AI recommendations
  before making their own. However, this result was not statistically significant.
  The results provide a first signal as to the viability of LLMs for personalized
  major recommendation and shed light on the promise and limitations of AI for advising
  support.
