abstract: 'One-on-one tutoring is an effective instructional method for enhancing
  learning, yet its efficacy hinges on tutor competencies. Novice math tutors often
  prioritize content-specific guidance, neglecting aspects such as social-emotional
  learning. Social-emotional learning promotes equity and inclusion and nurtures relationships
  with students, which is crucial for holistic student development. Assessing the
  competencies of tutors accurately and efficiently can drive the development of tailored
  tutor training programs. However, evaluating novice tutor ability during real-time
  tutoring remains challenging as it typically requires experts-in-the-loop. To address
  this challenge, this study harnesses Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPT),
  such as GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, to automatically assess tutorsâ€™ ability of using social-emotional
  tutoring strategies. Moreover, this study also reports on the financial dimensions
  and considerations of employing these models in real-time and at scale for automated
  assessment. Four prompting strategies were assessed: two basic Zero-shot prompt
  strategies, Tree of Thought prompting, and Retrieval-Augmented Generator (RAG) prompting.
  The results indicate that RAG prompting demonstrated the most accurate performance
  (assessed by the level of hallucination and correctness in the generated assessment
  texts) and the lowest financial costs. These findings inform the development of
  personalized tutor training interventions to enhance the educational effectiveness
  of tutored learning.'
