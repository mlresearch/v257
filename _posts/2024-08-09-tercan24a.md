abstract: 'Block-based visual programming environments play an increasingly important
  role in introducing computing concepts to K-12 students. The open-ended and conceptual
  nature of these visual programming tasks make them challenging for novice programmers.
  A natural approach to providing assistance for problem-solving is breaking down
  a complex task into a progression of simpler subtasks. However, this is not trivial
  given that the solution codes are typically nested and have non-linear execution
  behavior. In this paper, we formalize the problem of synthesizing such a progression
  for a given reference task in a visual programming domain. We propose a novel synthesis
  algorithm that generates a progression of subtasks that are high-quality, well-spaced
  in terms of their complexity, and solving this progression leads to solving the
  reference task. We conduct a user study to demonstrate that our synthesized progression
  of subtasks can assist a novice programmer in solving tasks from the Hour of Code:
