title: Current Evaluation Methods are a Bottleneck in Automatic Question Generation
booktitle: Proceedings of the 2024 AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence
year: '2024'
abstract: This study provides a comprehensive review of frequently used evaluation
  methods for assessing the quality of automatic question generation (AQG) systems
  based on computational linguistics techniques and large language models. As we present
  a comprehensive overview of the current state of evaluation methods, we discuss
  the advantages and limitations of each method. Furthermore, we elucidate the next
  steps for the full integration of automatic question generation systems in educational
  settings to achieve effective personalization and adaptation.
