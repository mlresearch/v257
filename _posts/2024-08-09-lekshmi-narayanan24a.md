title: 'Explaining code examples in introductory programming courses: Llm vs humans'
year: '2024'
journal: arXiv preprint arXiv:2403.05538
abstract: Worked examples, which present an explained code for solving typical programming
  problems are among the most popular types of learning content in programming classes.
  Most approaches and tools for presenting these examples to students are based on
  line-by-line explanations of the example code. However, instructors rarely have
  time to provide explanations for many examples typically used in a programming class.
  In this paper, we assess the feasibility of using LLMs to generate code explanations
  for passive and active example exploration systems. To achieve this goal, we compare
  the code explanations generated by chatGPT with the explanations generated by both
  experts and students.
