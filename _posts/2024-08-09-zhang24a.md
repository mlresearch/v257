abstract: 'We explore the general problem of learning to predict which teaching actions
  will result in the best learning outcomes for students in online courses. More specifically,
  we consider the problem of predicting which hint will most help a student who answers
  a practice question incorrectly, and who is about to make a second attempt to answer
  that question. In previous work we showed that log data from thousands of previous
  students could be used to learn empirically which of several pre-defined hints produces
  the best learning outcome. However, while that study utilized data from thousands
  of students submitting millions of responses, it did not consider the actual text
  of the question, the hint, or the answer. In this paper, we ask the follow-on question
  “Can we train a machine learned model to examine the text of the question, the answer,
  and the text of hints, to predict which hint will lead to better learning outcomes?”
  Our experimental results show that the answer is yes. This is important because
  the trained model can now be applied to new questions and hints covering related
  subject matter, to estimate which of the new hints will be most useful, even before
  testing it on students. Finally, we show that the pairs of hints for which the model
  makes most accurate predictions are the hint pairs where choosing the right hint
  has the biggest payoff (i.e., hint pairs for which the difference in learning outcomes
  is greatest). '
