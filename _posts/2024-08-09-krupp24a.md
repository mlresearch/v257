abstract: 'The increased presence of large language models (LLMs) in educational settings
  has ignited debates concerning negative repercussions, including overreliance and
  inadequate task reflection. Our work advocates moderated usage of such models, designed
  in a way that supports students and encourages critical thinking. We developed two
  moderated interaction methods with ChatGPT: hint-based assistance and presenting
  multiple answer choices. In a study with students (N=40) answering physics questions,
  we compared the effects of our moderated models against two baseline settings: unmoderated
  ChatGPT access and internet searches. We analyzed the interaction strategies and
  found that the moderated versions exhibited less unreflected usage (e.g., copy &
  paste) compared to the unmoderated condition. However, neither ChatGPT-supported
  condition could match the ratio of reflected usage present in internet searches.
  Our research highlights the potential benefits of moderating language models, showing
  a research direction toward designing effective AI-supported educational strategies.'
