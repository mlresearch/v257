abstract: 'This paper studies the problem of CPRP, concept prerequisite relation prediction,
  which is a fundamental task in using AI for education. CPRP is usually formulated
  into a link- prediction task on a relationship graph of concepts and solved by training
  the graph neural network (GNN) model. However, current directed GNNs fail to manage
  graph isomor- phism which refers to the invariance of non-isomorphic graphs, reducing
  the expressivity of resulting representations. We present a permutation-equivariant
  directed GNN model by introducing the Weisfeiler-Lehman test into directed GNN learning.
  Our method is then used for CPRP and evaluated on three public datasets. The experimental
  results show that our model delivers better prediction performance than the state-of-the-art
  methods. '
