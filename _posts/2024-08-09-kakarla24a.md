  Making Math Errors

abstract: Research suggests that tutors should adopt a strategic approach when addressing
  math errors made by low-efficacy students. Rather than drawing direct attention
  to the error, tutors should guide the students to identify and correct their mistakes
  on their own. While tutor lessons have introduced this pedagogical skill, human
  evaluation of tutors applying this strategy is arduous and time-consuming. Large
  language models (LLMs) show promise in providing real-time assessment to tutors
  during their actual tutoring sessions, yet little is known regarding their accuracy
  in this context. In this study, we investigate the capacity of generative AI to
  evaluate real-life tutors’ performance in responding to students making math errors.
  By analyzing 50 real-life tutoring dialogues, we find both GPT-3.5-Turbo and GPT-4
  demonstrate proficiency in assessing the criteria related to reacting to students
  making errors. However, both models exhibit limitations in recognizing instances
  where the student made an error. Notably, GPT-4 tends to overidentify instances
  of students making errors, often attributing student uncertainty or inferring potential
  errors where human evaluators did not. Future work will focus on enhancing generalizability
  by assessing a larger dataset of dialogues and evaluating learning transfer. Specifically,
  we will analyze the performance of tutors in real-life scenarios when responding
  to students’ math errors before and after lesson completion on this crucial tutoring
  skill.
