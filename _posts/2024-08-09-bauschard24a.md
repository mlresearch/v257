  AI Integration in Education'

abstract: This paper puts forth a novel research agenda called Augmented Debate-Centered
  Instruction (ADCI) to address a concerning gap in understanding the responsible
  integration of AI in education. As assessments grounded in individual writing become
  unreliable with the proliferation of language models, most attention has focused
  on detecting AI cheating rather than exploring pedagogical adaptations. This oversight
  leaves open critical questions about how generative AI might be leveraged to augment
  instructional practices and provide alternative modes of assessment, especially
  for developing essential cognitive abilities and durable skills.
