abstract: 'The recent program development industries have required problem-solving
  abilities for engineers, especially application developers. However, AI-based education
  systems to help solve computer algorithm problems have not yet attracted attention,
  while most big tech companies require the ability to solve algorithm problems including
  Google, Meta, and Amazon. The most useful guide to solving algorithm problems might
  be guessing the category (tag) of the facing problems. Therefore, our study addresses
  the task of predicting the algorithm tag as a useful tool for engineers and developers.
  Moreover, we also consider predicting the difficulty levels of algorithm problems,
  which can be used as useful guidance to calculate the required time to solve that
  problem. In this paper, we present a real-world algorithm problem multi-task dataset,
  AMT, by mainly collecting problem samples from the most famous and large competitive
  programming website Codeforces. To the best of our knowledge, our proposed dataset
  is the most large-scale dataset for predicting algorithm tags compared to previous
  studies. Moreover, our work is the first to address predicting the difficulty levels
  of algorithm problems. We present a deep learning-based novel method for simultaneously
  predicting algorithm tags and the difficulty levels of an algorithm problem given. '
